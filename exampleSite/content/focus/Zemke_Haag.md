barberiniharpproject = "The one most important surviving Italian Baroque harp the Barberini Harp is a chromatic harp with three parallel rows of strings constructed (1632-33) for the harpist Marco Marazzoli by the instrument maker Girolamo Acciari and the wood-carver Giovanni Tubi under the patronage of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. As we lack crucial understanding of this famous harp Harfenlabor has initiated The Barberini Harp Project in order to conduct and share basic research on this harp in the fields of organology musicology and performance practice and within relevant historical and art-historical contexts. This publication presents three stages of The Barberini Harp Project: 1. Convening around the Barberini Harp Project 2. Interviews with Experts and 3. Examinations."

description = "In 2018, Harfenlabor asked Thünen Institute for Wood Research to, for the first time ever, examine the wood on the Barberini Harp’s column, as well as other parts (some of which have been examined using different methods) using new non-invasive methodology, and identify the wood species used in the construction of the Barberini Harp. On December 16-18, 2018, Volker Haag and Valentina Zemke from the Thünen Institute for Wood Research carried out anatomical determination of structural features in order to identify the species of wood used to construct the harp, at the National Museum of Musical Instruments (Rome). In close consultation with the museum’s management, Haag and Zemke used the non-destructive high-resolution 3D Reflected Light Microscope. This special microscope has an integrated image analysis software enabling production of flat observation surfaces in order to identify structural features of wood. The structural features detected on the examined areas of the harp were compared with data held in the scientific wood collection at the Thünen Institute for Wood Research, and with databases of macro and micro wood data. Volker Haag presented the findings in a report to Harfenlabor, dated February 18, 2019:&&\n&&\n“According to macroscopic and microscopic structural features, the [wood of the] column and the neck corresponds completely to the wood of the botanical genus&&\nJuglans spp. = Walnut, walnut; from the JUGLANDACEAE family.&&\n&&\nThe [wood of the] soundboard corresponds completely to the wood of the botanical genus&&\nAbies spp. = Fir, fir; from the PINACEAE family.&&\n&&\nThe inner structural timber could be examined in the area of transition into the soundboard, and also shows complete agreement with the wood of the botanical genus&&\nAbies spp. = Fir, fir; from the PINACEAE family.&&\n&&\nThe soundbox of the Barberini Harp is also made of coniferous wood - further investigation was not possible at this point, since all of the damage to the paintwork has been brushed over or retouched several times over the centuries. Examination inside the instrument was not possible.&&\n&&\nThe examined button [wood] shows complete correspondence with the wood of the botanical genus&&\nBuxus spp. = Boxwood, box; from the BUXACEAE family.”"
