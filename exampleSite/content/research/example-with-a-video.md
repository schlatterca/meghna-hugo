barberiniharpproject = "The one most important surviving Italian Baroque harp the Barberini Harp is a chromatic harp with three parallel rows of strings constructed (1632-33) for the harpist Marco Marazzoli by the instrument maker Girolamo Acciari and the wood-carver Giovanni Tubi under the patronage of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. As we lack crucial understanding of this famous harp Harfenlabor has initiated The Barberini Harp Project in order to conduct and share basic research on this harp in the fields of organology musicology and performance practice and within relevant historical and art-historical contexts. This publication presents three stages of The Barberini Harp Project: 1. Convening around the Barberini Harp Project 2. Interviews with Experts and 3. Examinations."
description = "Practical Examination of the Barberini Harp&&\nEric Kleinmann, harp maker&&\n&&\nRenowned master historical harp builder Eric Kleinmann presents his research and examination of the Barberini Harp in preparation for construction of a facsimile. He observed changes to the neck of the original harp: What were the consequences? One of them is string length—Kleinmann made a small harp to test the presumed original stringing and the current stringing. Examinations revealed the harp’s neck had been hollowed out since it was originally made: Why? In addition, cracks were found in gilding, and a later addition of decoration has been found to disturb the lowest strings; and unexplained pinholes do not correspond to soundboard holes. Based on his examination, Kleinmann believes that the soundboard is not original. Dendrochronological examination found that the wood for it was growing between 1341–1644, before and during the Little Ice Age. The soundboard was made with wood grown up until 1605. 360-degree camera footage from inside the neck revealed repairs labels on the inside; some strange objects were found inside the soundbox. The ties on the harp are exquisitely crafted and a little unusual. Finally, Kleinmann is convinced that the column could not have been made in walnut wood. He has subsequently been proven wrong by Volker Haag and the two are now planning to collaborate on the issues arising from examinations."
