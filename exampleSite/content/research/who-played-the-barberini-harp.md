I cannot add facts or new hypotheses to the question of who really played the Barberini Harp. Rather, I wish to present a whole panorama of harpists who were active in the first half of the 17th century in Rome, discuss where they performed, the circles and contexts, issues they faced – and in this way, in fact, end up with the question of whether they could have played the Barberini Harp or a similar instrument.

**<span tag="HL_names">Marco Marazzoli</span>**

(Parma c. 1602/1605 – 1662 Rome)

Unlike **<span tag="HL_names">Orazio Michi**</span>, [Marco Marazzoli](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Marazzoli "Marco Marazzoli") is remembered more as a composer, than as a singer and harpist, as he left a considerable number of compositions behind. This includes cantate and canzonette, similar to works by **<span tag="HL_names">**[Luigi Rossi](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Rossi "Luigi Rossi")**</span>**, **<span tag="HL_names">Giacomo Carissimi**</span> or Michi, but also music for the stage, especially for big productions for the [Palazzo Barberini](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Barberini "Palazzo Barberini") in Rome. His instrumental music, however, is limited to parts of these theatrical works. Furthermore, his radius extended far beyond Rome: he was also active, for example, in Ferrara and Paris. Born around 1602 in Parma, Marazzoli moved to Rome in 1626.

Sometime afterwards, he entered the service of **<span tag="HL_names">Cardinal Antonio Barberini**</span>, probably as a harpist, as in July 1629 strings were bought for a harp used by Marazzoli. We have already heard considerations of whether or not these could have been intended for the Barberini Harp. In any case, we know that a 1636 inventory of Antonio Barberini’s possessions mentions the harp as having been entrusted to Marco Marazzoli: “Un’arpa grande tutta intagliata, dorata, con sue corde in mano a Marco Marazzoli.“ In this period, or, at any rate, no later than 1634, Marazzoli gave harp lessons to painter Giovanni Lanfranco’s daughter. As compensation, he asked the painter for three paintings, among them the _Venere che suona l’arpa_. It was probably Marazzoli who played the harp for the ostentatious _Giostra del Saracino_ (Saracen Joust) given in 1634 on the Piazza Navona by Antonio Barberini. Marazzoli’s participation at this event is documented in the etching _La nave di Bacco_ by François Collignon after Andrea Sacchi. From 1634, Marazzoli regularly held _benefice_ at Santa Maria Maggiore, Antonio Barberini’s titular church. We have already mentioned this church because of the presence of harpists at the devotions of the Quarantore in the Paoline chapel. In 1637, Marazzoli entered the Papal chapel as a tenor, and the cardinal’s household as _aiutante di camera_, but it was only in 1639 that Marazzoli gained the position as Barberini’s _musico_. Before this date, therefore, it is quite difficult to verify his role as a composer.

There are several intermedi and other stage works for which Marazzoli composed music, and probably also performed as singer and harpist. I would like to mention as examples, the intermedi to Virgilio Mazzocchi’s _Chi soffre speri_ for Carnival 1639, and _La Fiera di Farfa_, composed in Rome and performed in the Barberini palace with set design by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In 1643, at Cardinal Mazarin’s invitation, Marazzoli left Rome for a stay in Paris with a company of Italian musicians, including the singer Leonora Baroni. Upon his return to Rome in 1645, Marazzoli was deprived of opera opportunities, because the Barberini family had in the meanwhile been exiled to France. In the following years, he therefore composed Latin and Italian oratorios. His last oratorios may have been written for the Oratory of San Filippo Neri in Rome about 1650. Following Antonio Barberini’s return to Rome in 1654, Marazzoli became the principal composer for the new Barberini opera series that started with a collaboration with Antonio Maria Abbatini on their opera _Dal male il bene_, performed during Carnival 1654 at the Teatro Barberini. Important are also his last two operas, _La vita humana, ovvero Il trionfo della pietà_ and _Le armi e gli amori_. His will, drawn up about 1660, names especially his handmaid as well as, among others, several members of the Barberini family, who inherited, for example, the Lanfranco’s painting _Venere che suona l’arpa_. Two years later, in 1662, Marazzoli died after a serious accident and was buried in the Chiesa Nuova, like Orazio Michi.

Whilst all the harpists mentioned thus far were in the service of Antonio Barberini, Francesco Barberini, rivaling his brother, also employed more than one harpist:

**Carlo Moretti**

In 1631, Girolamo Acciari worked on a harp that he delivered to Stefano Landi, for a Carlo Moretti, musician for Francesco Barberini, and probably a boy singer. At the Carneval of 1639, Carlo Moretti sang in Virgilio Mazzocchi’s rappresentazione spirituale _San Bonifatio_.

**Stefano Landi**

Stefano Landi, today known mainly as a composer, was also a singer who played Spanish guitar and – according to Frederick Hammond – a virtuoso harpist. He never became a part of Barberini’s household, but served both the pope and all three Barberini nephews. Landi supplied Marin Mersenne with the description of a triple harp for his _Harmonie Universelle_ of 1636, on recommendation by Jean Jacques Bouchard, Francesco Barberini’s secretary. We do not know whether Landi ever managed to compile a book of compositions for triple harp, as Mersenne documented that he wanted to.

**Antonio Maria Ciacchi**

Shortly after Girolamo Frescobaldi’s arrival in 1634, Antonio Maria Ciacchi was engaged as third instrumentalist, originally a lutenist, at the Barberini court. At the same time, he served as custodian for Barberini’s collection of musical instruments. His name often appears in connection with the acquisition of strings for viols or lutes, or transporting of instruments between the different Barberini palaces. In 1634, Giovanni Acciari constructed a harp for Ciacchi, funded by Francesco Barberini. In 1636, five books of music were bound for him.

**Giovanni Carpano**

Another _sonatore_ of the Barberini circle who, in 1636, regularly received harp strings, was Giovanni Carpano, a pupil of Virgilio Mazzocchi, and also a harpsichordist. In the same year, a book of instrumental sonate was copied for him. Like Giovan Carlo Rossi and Carlo Moretti he participated in the performance of _San Bonifatio_ at the Carnival of 1638 and that of _La pazzia d’Orlando_.

**Carlo Fausto**

Carlo Fausto is also mentioned, in passing, as having been in the service of Francesco Barberini, as a harp and guitar maker and, according to Frederick Hammond, also a harpist.

**Conclusion**

Two major influences conflated in the first half of the 17th century concerning the harpists in Rome: Firstly, at the start of the century, the Neapolitan harp-virtuosos began sojourning in Rome, to, later on, relocate completely to Rome where the demand for them was great. During the 1610s and 1620s, the concept of the _concerto delle donne_, originating in Ferrara, was imported to Rome, where similar ensembles arose or where ensembles from outside gave guest performances. These were the foundation for later harpists, such as Orazio Michi who was of Neapolitan origin, but seems to have had his first successes in Rome where he remained for the rest of his life. The courts of the cardinals, the Borghese and above all the Barberini, absorbed these two musical fashions, the Neapolitan harp virtuoso and the _concerto delle donne_. They began by engaging musicians from outside, like Francesca Caccini and the Baroni sisters, but later on established a large number of their own harpists. Musicians like Luigi Rossi, Carlo Moretti, Antonio Maria Ciacchi and Giovanni Carpano seem to have entered the courts as musicians, usually as lutenists or harpsichordists, to later on also play the harp.

The two Barberini nephews, Antonio and Francesco Barberini, rivalled each other through their musical events – and so most likely through the harpists in their employ. These were either simply continuo players or, like Lucrezia Urbani, Costanza de Ponte, Orazio Michi and Marco Marazzoli, great harp virtuosos. The music the Barberini family patronized, obviously served as pleasing entertainment, but, importantly, also as a demonstration of their good taste, their education, their being on trend – and their political power. To demonstrate this, it was surely of advantage not only to employ the best musicians playing contemporary and fanciful music, but also to have them play on admirable instruments, visible to everyone in the audience. Given these preconditions and the great number of harpists employed, I can but support Chiara Granata’s thesis that there may have existed many more than one _Barberini harp_.
