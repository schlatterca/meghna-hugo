barberiniharpproject = "The one most important surviving Italian Baroque harp the Barberini Harp is a chromatic harp with three parallel rows of strings constructed (1632-33) for the harpist Marco Marazzoli by the instrument maker Girolamo Acciari and the wood-carver Giovanni Tubi under the patronage of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. As we lack crucial understanding of this famous harp Harfenlabor has initiated The Barberini Harp Project in order to conduct and share basic research on this harp in the fields of organology musicology and performance practice and within relevant historical and art-historical contexts. This publication presents three stages of The Barberini Harp Project: 1. Convening around the Barberini Harp Project 2. Interviews with Experts and 3. Examinations."
description = "The paper does not intend to seek a definite answer to this question, but rather to begin setting the context for harp performance practices of the early 17th century Rome, by mapping the known harpists of the time. The period saw two major influences conflate in Rome: the relocation of Neapolitan harp virtuosi and the import of the Ferraran concept of concerto delle donne, resulting in a rich, vibrant scene. Powerful Roman families, most notably the Barberini and the Borghese, encouraged and shaped this development through patronage of many musicians, in demonstration of their good taste, education, and political power.&&\nThe patronage demanded visibility, which was also insured through construction of richly decorated instruments, like the Barberini Harp. The author thus states support for Chiara Granata’s hypothesis that there may have existed more than one Barberini Harp. "

I cannot add facts or new hypotheses to the question of who really played the Barberini Harp. Rather, I wish to present a whole panorama of harpists who were active in the first half of the 17th century in Rome, discuss where they performed, the circles and contexts, issues they faced – and in this way, in fact, end up with the question of whether they could have played the Barberini Harp or a similar instrument.

**Marco Marazzoli**

(<span id="map_tag">Parma</span> c. <span id="timeline_tag">1602</span>/<span id="timeline_tag">1605</span> – <span id="timeline_tag">1662</span> <span id="map_tag">Roma</span>)

Unlike <span id="person_tag">Orazio Michi</span>, <span id="person_tag">Marco Marazzoli</span> is remembered more as a composer, than as a singer and harpist, as he left a considerable number of compositions behind. This includes cantate and canzonette, similar to works by <span id="person_tag">Luigi Rossi</span>, <span id="person_tag">Giacomo Carissimi</span> or Michi, but also music for the stage, especially for big productions for the <span id="map_tag">Palazzo Barberini</span> in Rome. His instrumental music, however, is limited to parts of these theatrical works. Furthermore, his radius extended far beyond Rome: he was also active, for example, in <span id="map_tag">Ferrara</span> and <span id="map_tag">Paris</span>. Born around <span id="timeline_tag">1602</span> in Parma, Marazzoli moved to Rome in <span id="timeline_tag">1626</span>.

###### Celebrazioni per Cristina di Svezia presso il Palazzo barberini nel 1656. Marazzoli compose la musica per questo evento.

Sometime afterwards, he entered the service of Cardinal <span id="person_tag">Antonio Barberini</span>, probably as a harpist, as in July <span id="timeline_tag">1629</span> strings were bought for a harp used by Marazzoli. We have already heard considerations of whether or not these could have been intended for the Barberini Harp. In any case, we know that a <span id="timeline_tag">1636</span> inventory of Antonio Barberini’s possessions mentions the harp as having been entrusted to Marco Marazzoli: “Un’arpa grande tutta intagliata, dorata, con sue corde in mano a Marco Marazzoli.“<sup>1</sup> In this period, or, at any rate, no later than <span id="timeline_tag">1634</span>, Marazzoli gave harp lessons to painter <span id="person_tag">Giovanni Lanfranco</span>’s daughter. As compensation, he asked the painter for three paintings, among them the _Venere che suona l’arpa_. It was probably Marazzoli who played the harp for the ostentatious _Giostra del Saracino_ (Saracen Joust) given in 1634 on the Piazza Navona by Antonio Barberini. Marazzoli’s participation at this event is documented in the etching _La nave di Bacco_ by <span id="person_tag">François Collignon</span> after <span id="person_tag">Andrea Sacchi</span>. From 1634, Marazzoli regularly held _benefice_ at Santa Maria Maggiore, Antonio Barberini’s titular church. We have already mentioned this church because of the presence of harpists at the devotions of the Quarantore in the Paoline chapel. In 1637, Marazzoli entered the <span id="subjects_tag">Papal chapel</span> as a tenor, and the cardinal’s household as _aiutante di camera_, but it was only in <span id="timeline_tag">1639</span> that Marazzoli gained the position as Barberini’s _musico_. Before this date, therefore, it is quite difficult to verify his role as a composer.

###### Il cardinale Antonio Barberini.

There are several intermedi and other stage works for which Marazzoli composed music, and probably also performed as singer and harpist. I would like to mention as examples, the intermedi to <span id="person_tag">Virgilio Mazzocchi</span>’s _Chi soffre speri_ for Carnival <span id="timeline_tag">1639</span>, and _La Fiera di Farfa_, composed in Rome and performed in the Barberini palace with set design by <span id="person_tag">Gian Lorenzo Bernini</span>. In <span id="timeline_tag">1643</span>, at Cardinal Mazarin’s invitation, Marazzoli left Rome for a stay in Paris with a company of Italian musicians, including the singer <span id="person_tag">Leonora Baroni</span>. Upon his return to Rome in <span id="timeline_tag">1645</span>, Marazzoli was deprived of opera opportunities, because the Barberini family had in the meanwhile been exiled to France. In the following years, he therefore composed Latin and Italian oratorios. His last oratorios may have been written for the <span id="subjects_tag">Oratory of San Filippo Neri</span> in Rome about <span id="timeline_tag">1650</span>. Following Antonio Barberini’s return to Rome in <span id="timeline_tag">1654</span>, Marazzoli became the principal composer for the new Barberini opera series that started with a collaboration with <span id="person_tag">Antonio Maria Abbatini</span> on their opera _Dal male il bene_, performed during Carnival <span id="timeline_tag">1654</span> at the <span id="subjects_tag">Teatro Barberini</span>. Important are also his last two operas, _La vita humana, ovvero Il trionfo della pietà_ and _Le armi e gli amori_. His will, drawn up about <span id="timeline_tag">1660</span>, names especially his handmaid as well as, among others, several members of the Barberini family, who inherited, for example, the Lanfranco’s painting _Venere che suona l’arpa_. Two years later, in <span id="timeline_tag">1662</span>, Marazzoli died after a serious accident and was buried in the <span id="subjects_tag">Chiesa Nuova</span>, like Orazio Michi.

Whilst all the harpists mentioned thus far were in the service of Antonio Barberini, <span id="person_tag">Francesco Barberini</span>, rivaling his brother, also employed more than one harpist:

<span id="person_tag">**Carlo Moretti**</span>

In <span id="timeline_tag">1631</span>, <span id="person_tag">Girolamo Acciari</span> worked on a harp that he delivered to <span id="person_tag">Stefano Landi</span>, for a Carlo Moretti, musician for Francesco Barberini, and probably a boy singer<sup>2</sup>. At the Carneval of <span id="timeline_tag">1639</span>, Carlo Moretti sang in Virgilio Mazzocchi’s rappresentazione spirituale _San Bonifatio_<sup>3</sup>.

**Stefano Landi**

Stefano Landi, today known mainly as a composer, was also a singer who played Spanish guitar and – according to <span id="person_tag">Frederick Hammond</span> – a virtuoso harpist. He never became a part of Barberini’s household, but served both the pope and all three Barberini nephews. Landi supplied <span id="person_tag">Marin Mersenne</span> with the description of a triple harp for his _Harmonie Universelle_ of <span id="timeline_tag">1636</span>, on recommendation by <span id="person_tag">Jean Jacques Bouchard</span>, Francesco Barberini’s secretary<sup>4</sup>. We do not know whether Landi ever managed to compile a book of compositions for triple harp, as Mersenne documented that he wanted to<sup>5</sup>.

<span id="person_tag">**Antonio Maria Ciacchi**</span>

Shortly after <span id="person_tag">Girolamo Frescobaldi</span>’s arrival in <span id="timeline_tag">1634</span>, Antonio Maria Ciacchi was engaged as third instrumentalist, originally a lutenist, at the <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini court</span>. At the same time, he served as custodian for <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini collection of musical instruments</span>. His name often appears in connection with the acquisition of strings for viols or lutes, or transporting of instruments between the different Barberini palaces. In <span id="timeline_tag">1634</span>, Giovanni Acciari constructed a harp for Ciacchi, funded by Francesco Barberini<sup>6</sup>. In <span id="timeline_tag">1636</span>, five books of music were bound for him<sup>7</sup>.

<span id="person_tag">**Giovanni Carpano**</span>

Another _sonatore_ of the Barberini circle who, in <span id="timeline_tag">1636</span>, regularly received harp strings, was Giovanni Carpano, a pupil of <span id="person_tag">Virgilio Mazzocchi</span>,<sup>8</sup> and also a harpsichordist. In the same year, a book of instrumental sonate was copied for him<sup>9</sup>. Like Giovan Carlo Rossi and Carlo Moretti he participated in the performance of _San Bonifatio_ at the Carnival of <span id="timeline_tag">1638</span> and that of _La pazzia d’Orlando_<sup>10</sup>.

<span id="person_tag">**Carlo Fausto**</span>

Carlo Fausto is also mentioned, in passing, as having been in the service of Francesco Barberini, as a harp and guitar maker and, according to Frederick Hammond, also a harpist<sup>11</sup>.

**Conclusion**

Two major influences conflated in the first half of the <span id="timeline_tag">17th century</span> concerning the harpists in Rome: Firstly, at the start of the century, the Neapolitan harp-virtuosos began sojourning in Rome, to, later on, relocate completely to Rome where the demand for them was great. During the <span id="timeline_tag">1610</span>s and <span id="timeline_tag">1620</span>s, the concept of the _concerto delle donne_, originating in Ferrara, was imported to Rome, where similar ensembles arose or where ensembles from outside gave guest performances. These were the foundation for later harpists, such as Orazio Michi who was of Neapolitan origin, but seems to have had his first successes in Rome where he remained for the rest of his life. The courts of the cardinals, the Borghese and above all the Barberini, absorbed these two musical fashions, the Neapolitan harp virtuoso and the _concerto delle donne_. They began by engaging musicians from outside, like <span id="person_tag">Francesca Caccini</span> and the Baroni sisters, but later on established a large number of their own harpists. Musicians like Luigi Rossi, Carlo Moretti, Antonio Maria Ciacchi and Giovanni Carpano seem to have entered the courts as musicians, usually as lutenists or harpsichordists, to later on also play the harp.

The two Barberini nephews, Antonio and Francesco Barberini, rivalled each other through their musical events – and so most likely through the harpists in their employ. These were either simply continuo players or, like <span id="person_tag">Lucrezia Urbani</span>, <span id="person_tag">Costanza de Ponte</span>, Orazio Michi and Marco Marazzoli, great harp virtuosos. The music the Barberini family patronized, obviously served as pleasing entertainment, but, importantly, also as a demonstration of their good taste, their education, their being on trend – and their political power. To demonstrate this, it was surely of advantage not only to employ the best musicians playing contemporary and fanciful music, but also to have them play on admirable instruments, visible to everyone in the audience. Given these preconditions and the great number of harpists employed, I can but support <span id="person_tag">Chiara Granata</span>’s thesis that there may have existed many more than one _Barberini harp_.
