I cannot add facts or new hypotheses to the question of who really played the Barberini Harp. Rather, I wish to present a whole panorama of harpists who were active in the first half of the 17th century in Rome, discuss where they performed, the circles and contexts, issues they faced – and in this way, in fact, end up with the question of whether they could have played the Barberini Harp or a similar instrument.

<p style="text-align: center">Marco Marazzoli  
(Parma c. 1602/1605 – 1662 Rome)</p>

Unlike Orazio Michi, [Marco Marazzoli](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Marazzoli "Marco Marazzoli") is remembered more as a composer, than as a singer and harpist, as he left a considerable number of compositions behind. This includes cantate and canzonette, similar to works by [Luigi Rossi](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Rossi "Luigi Rossi"), Giacomo Carissimi or Michi, but also music for the stage, especially for big productions for the [Palazzo Barberini](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Barberini "Palazzo Barberini") in Rome.
